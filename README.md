# HiggsML

The aim of this project is to improve the discovery significance of ATLAS experiment through ML techniques. The objective of that experiment was to isolate tau tau decays of Higgs Boson, separing signal from background. This repo contains the implementation of a DNN yielding AUC and Poisson Significance fo the experiment.
